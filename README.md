# Mandelbrot

The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers c such that the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} converges when repeatedly iterated from z = 0. This project simply allows one to visualize the set if the horizontal axis was treated as the real axis, and the vertical axis as the complex axis. This is a primitive visualization of the Mandelbrot set using the p5.js library. My next steps are to use a more robust and powerful 2D graphics tool to visualize the set and allow people to zoom into the resulting image much further.
